# Introduction:

People nowadays are continuously in need of more assistance systems. Individuals are now being directed to look for other markets due to the rapid rise in the flow of information, and people have entered the race to create excellent items at a low cost. This requires the use of automation technologies. Because standardized automation systems, as well as skilled and well-trained workers, are essential for high-quality goods. People had to employ auxiliary equipment in regions where their strength was insufficient due to their physical traits. With the advancement of technology, many devices that formerly required human aid to work have been created to operate spontaneously without the need for human power. Robots are one of the most common components of automation systems. Robotic systems have brought together Mechatronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Engineering to collaborate. Research will be done and incorporated in the project in order to have knowledge of mechanics and software throughout the operations carried out by the robot arm, which is meant to do tasks based on predefined orders.

# Problem Statement:

Humans conduct all operations in today's warehouses, either entirely or partially. Some warehouses evolved and incorporated equipment into their operations as a result of technological improvements, allowing for easier loading and unloading procedures. Not only that, but these machines increased speed and assured human safety in the instance of hazardous materials. These are not, however, automatic systems; their movements are guided by humans. Humans are also in charge of updating and managing the inventory. As a result, there is a lot of room for improvement in every activity.

# Objective:

This project aims to build a Robotic Arm with Real-Time Image Processing on a mobile robot unit that will be operated automatically using a Raspberry Pi. In this project, we'll build a robot that can identify and place a pre-defined object. Python will be used to write the object detection function. For the hardware implementation, we're using a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS, which is based on Debian Linux. The robotic arm recognizes and categorizes the pre-specified objects based on colour (RGB). Controlling the robotic arm, capturing the object using image processing, identifying the RGB object, and doing all tasks automatically using Raspberry Pi are all part of the programme .
